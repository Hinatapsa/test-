    <p>Definition: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtualized, platform-independent computing environment that executes Java bytecode. It serves as an abstraction layer between compiled Java programs and the underlying hardware and operating system.</p>

    <h>2.DESCRIBE ADOUT DVM?</h>
    <p>Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)</p>
    <SPACE></SPACE>
    <p>Introduction:

    DVM was a virtual machine specifically designed for the Android operating system to run Android applications</p>
    <p>Execution of Android Apps:

        Android applications were traditionally written in Java and compiled into bytecode. The bytecode was then converted into Dalvik Executable (.dex) format, which the DVM could understand and execute.</p>
        <p>Optimizations for Mobile Devices:

            Dalvik was optimized for mobile devices with limited resources. It used techniques such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert bytecode into native machine code at runtime, improving the performance of Android apps</p>
           <p>Memory Efficiency:

            DVM was designed to be memory-efficient, which is crucial for mobile devices. It implemented garbage collection to manage memory resources and reclaim memory occupied by objects that were no longer in use.</p> 
            <p>Multi-Tasking Support:

                Android devices typically run multiple applications simultaneously. DVM supported multi-tasking by managing the execution of multiple app processes efficiently.</p>
                <p>Transition to ART (Android Runtime):

                    With the release of Android 5.0 (Lollipop), Google introduced the Android Runtime (ART) as a replacement for Dalvik. ART uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, which converts bytecode into machine code during the app installation phase rather than at runtime.</p>
